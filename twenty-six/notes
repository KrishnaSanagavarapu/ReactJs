Pure component.js

rpce

waht is the difference between pure componet and component
and containing Parent component with state

Pure componenet will not re-render

Regular componenent
a regular componenent does not implment the shouldComponentUpdate method.
It always returns true by default

Pure Component 
A pure component on the other hand implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow 
props and state comparision


Shallow Comparision(SC)

a (SC) b returns true if a and b have the same value and are of the same type

Complex Types

a (SC) b returns true if a and b reference the same exact object.

Pure Component 

A pure component implements shouldCompleteUpdate with a shallow prop and state
comparision

pure components - checks preious state with current state adn will not re-render
if parent will not re-render child will not 

pure comp -> preevent unnecessary render can give you performace boost in certain conditions

we should not mutate objects or arrays in props or state

if we need to add item to the list, dont push the item into list the reference
to the array never changes 

Summary
-we can create a component by extending the PureComponent Class
-A pure compoennt implements the shouldCOmponentUpdate lifecycle method by performing 
a shallow Comparision on the props and the state of the component
-if there is no difference, the component is not re-rendered - performace boost
-It is a good idea to ensure that all the children compoenets are also pure to avoid 
to avoid unexpected behavior
-never mutate the state. Always return a new object reflects the new state
