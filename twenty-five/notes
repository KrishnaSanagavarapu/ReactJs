Fragments

multiple tags cannot be retuned
they need to be in div tags

<React.Fragment>
remove the div tags

td cannot be div tag - it will show error in console
for this we use React.Fragment

it can accpet key value - that can be only passed - in fragrments

instead of React.Fragment
with
<>
</>
- we cannot pass in key value
